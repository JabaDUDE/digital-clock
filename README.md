## My process

This was sort of just a random project I decided to work on. I wanted to create a countdown timer; however, I didn't have a firm understanding on how the dates and syntax related to it worked. So I found a simple code for it online to follow, but this time, I played around with the code. Broke it, rebuilt it, broke it again. 
I wanted to figure out a way to have it so that when you click on the button, the clock would be replaced by either the 12-hr time format or the 24-hour format. However, I could not figure out how to make it so one replaced the other. Display: none would not work. So I ended up doing something that I liked way more which was have it so that the times appear to be surrounding the button in the center.  Also found that the font size was too big for phone size, so added a little responsivenesss so it looks more smooth.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

During this project, I learned a lot more about using dates when using Javascript.

### Continued development

I want to possibly add a little more aesthetic to the page. The black background with blue text color, as well as the font family I used make it look really nice. 
But it's still a little bland.
